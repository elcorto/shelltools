! Set some attributes (mostly color stuff) for xterm. If this file is named
! ~/.Xresources, then you need xrdb to load settings. If it is named
! ~/.Xdefaults-<hostname>, then each starting X app (like xterm) reads it.
!
! To list all loaded settings:
!   $ appres xterm
!
! Change and test new settings (Xresources only):
!   [ edit ~/.Xresources ]
!   $ xrdb -load ~/.Xresources # delete all settings, only the ones in the
!                              # resource file will take effect
!   or
!   $ xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
!   [ open new xterm to see effects ]
